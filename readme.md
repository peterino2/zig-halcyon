# Overview 

Halcyon is the ultimate script for producing rich and reactive interactive fiction.


Here's what we aim to provide. By v0.5.0.

#### ðŸ“œ A simple language

- Inspired by Renpy, author content in a syntax that is a joy to write in.
- Incredibly powerful and simple scripting system.
- Text-based source file management.

```
George: Hello! how are you?
    Emilia > I'm doing great!
        George: Wonderful!
    Emilia > Uhh not so well.
        George: Huh, well why don't you tell me what's going on?

#### ðŸ“œ A beautiful runtime

- Games are demanding for performance. Thats why this runtime is natively written in zig âš¡, it features no garbage collection, minimal memory footprint, and puts you in charge of it's compute.
- Don't pay for what you don't use, the event system can be completely turned off.  Debug features can be stripped from production builds.
- A lighting fast data oriented architecture and ECS runtime, hot-reload scripts while you're playing.
- No dependencies. Other than the zig standard library, no messy dependencies are brought into your system

#### ðŸ“œ Debugging for everyone

- Get superpowers with the halcyon debugger. Debug game instances, step forward, and backwards, edit quest facts.
- Connect to remote instances via a debug server architecture.
- Debug multiplayer sessions, save and load gamestates.

#### ðŸ“œ Quality at every step of production
- Databases and spreadsheets for localization can be generated with a click of a button. All text is locally tagged with keys for localization.
- Manage auxilary content such as recordings directly within project files.
- Bake and cook entire games with hundreds of thousands of lines of text into compact, production ready shippable binaries.
- Goal is to be in use in AA and AAA companies.

#### ðŸ“œ Seamless integration with your projects

- Plugins and prebuilt asset packages for Unreal Engine and Unity, will be available through the asset store and marketplace.
- Sane defaults and rich examples lets you get started with writing right away.

#### ðŸ“œ An open ecosystem

- Written in zig, a next-generation systems programming language that provides actual super powers, the runtime cross compiles for all modern systems including android, IOS and Consoles (bring your own sdk).
- The runtime and parser are entirely open source. Write your extensions and tools and have them be compiled natively.
- An open C Header API is published as well for you to write your own bindings.
- Write your own plugins and extensions onto the system, default distrobutions of the runtime come with the editor and the zig compiler.

### Development

The tool is currently in development by just me, Peterino. I am an engine and tools developer who works in the AAA gamedev space and wanted to have an elegant solution for my personal projects that is comparable or better to the tools I am familiar with at work.

The tool is undergoing heavy development and is not publically available (yet).
