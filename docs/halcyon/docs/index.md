# Overview 

Halcyon is the ultimate script for producing rich and reactive interactive fiction.

Here's what we aim to provide. By v0.5.0.

#### ðŸ“œ A simple language

- Inspired by Renpy, author content in a syntax that is a joy to write in.
- Incredibly powerful yet simple. Mix scripting with manuscript on the fly.
- Text-based source file management.

```
George: Hello! how are you?
    > Emilia: I'm doing great!
        George: Wonderful!
    > Emilia: Uhh not so well.
        George: Huh, well why don't you tell me what's going on?

#### ðŸ“œ A beautiful runtime

- Games are demanding for performance. Thats why this runtime is natively written in zig âš¡, it features no garbage collection, minimal memory footprint, and puts you in charge of it's compute.
- Don't pay for what you don't use, the event system and debug features can be completely turned off.
- A lighting fast data oriented runtime with an ECS architecture, hot-reload scripts while you're playing.
- No dependencies. Other than a tiny static link to the zig standard library, no messy dependencies are brought into your system.

#### ðŸ“œ Debugging for everyone

- Full featured debugging. Debug game instances, step forward, and backwards, edit quest facts.
- Connect to remote instances via a debug server.
- Debug multiplayer sessions, save and load gamestates.
- Play and write at the same time, take seconds not hours to iterate.

#### ðŸ“œ Quality at every step of production
- Databases and spreadsheets for localization can be generated with a click of a button. All text is locally tagged with keys for localization.
- Manage auxilary content such as recordings directly within project files.
- Bake and cook entire games with hundreds of thousands of lines of text into compact, production ready shippable binaries.
- A goal of this project is to be in use by AA and AAA releases.

#### ðŸ“œ Seamless integration with your projects
- Plugins and prebuilt packages for Unreal Engine and Unity will be available.
- Sane defaults and rich examples lets you get started with writing right away.

#### ðŸ“œ An open ecosystem
- Written in zig, a next-generation systems programming language that provides actual super powers.
- The runtime cross compiles for all modern systems including android, IOS and Consoles (bring your own sdk if you got one).
- The runtime and parser are entirely open source.
- Bindings planned for more languages and frameworks.

### Development

The tool is currently in development by just me, Peterino. I am an engine and tools developer who works in the AAA gamedev space and wanted to have an elegant solution for my personal projects that is comparable or better to the tools I am familiar with at work.

The tool is undergoing heavy development and is not publically available (yet).
