# Overview 

Halcyon is the ultimate script for producing rich and reactive interactive fiction.


Here's what we aim to provide. by v0.5.0

#### ðŸ“œ A simple language

- Inspired by Renpy, author content in a syntax that is a joy to write in.
- Incredibly powerful and simple scripting system.
- Text-based source file management.

```
George: Hello! how are you?
    Emilia > I'm doing great!
        George: Wonderful!
    Emilia > Uhh not so well.
        George: Huh, well why don't you tell me what's going on?
        @goto emilia_explains_her_problem
```

#### ðŸ“œ A beautiful runtime

- Games are demanding for performance. Thats why this runtime is natively written in zig âš¡, it features no garbage collection, minimal memory footprint, and puts you in charge of it's compute.
- Don't pay for what you don't use, the event system can be completely turned off.  Debug features can be stripped from production builds.
- A lighting fast data oriented architecture and ECS runtime, hot-reload scripts while you're playing.
- No dependencies. Other than the zig standard library, no messy dependencies are brought into your system

#### ðŸ“œ Debugging for everyone

- Get superpowers with the halcyon debugger. Debug game instances, step forward, and backwards, edit quest facts.
- Connect to remote instances via a debug server architecture.
- Debug multiplayer sessions, save and load gamestates.

#### ðŸ“œ Quality at every step of production
- Databases and spreadsheets for localization can be generated with a click of a button. All text is locally tagged with keys for localization.
- Manage auxilary content such as recordings directly within project files.
- Bake and cook entire games with hundreds of thousands of lines of text into compact, production ready shippable binaries.
- Goal is to be in use in AA and AAA companies.

#### ðŸ“œ Seamless integration with your projects

- Plugins and prebuilt asset packages for Unreal Engine and Unity, will be available through the asset store and marketplace.
- Sane defaults and rich examples lets you get started with writing right away.

#### ðŸ“œ An open ecosystem

- Written in zig, a next-generation systems programming language that provides actual super powers, the runtime cross compiles for all modern systems including android, IOS and Consoles (bring your own sdk).
- The runtime and parser are entirely open source. Write your extensions and tools and have them be compiled natively.
- An open C Header API is published as well for you to write your own bindings.
- Write your own plugins and extensions onto the system, default distrobutions of the runtime come with the editor and the zig compiler.

### Development

The tool is currently in development by just me, Peterino. I am an engine and tools developer who works in the AAA gamedev space and wanted to have an elegant solution for my personal projects that is comparable or better to the tools I am familiar with at work.

# The language

The scripting language is loosely inspired by renpy. To declare a stream of dialogue, simply write it like thus.

```
PersonA: Hello! Great day isn't it?
PersonB: Man.. I really hate the way you talk so nicely.
PersonA: Haha you sure got me there! I really am a nice person.
PersonB: Get the hell away from me.
```


Dialogues can be written with with just the format \[Speaker\] : \[content\]
and each dialogue ends with a newline.

```
PersonA: This is a really long piece of dialogue 
: So I can extend it like this
```

### Conditionals

Single dialogue can be decorated with an if statement.

```
@if(PersonA_is_pissed)
PersonA: I am pissed off
PersonA: I will say this line regardless of if I'm pissed off or not.
```

Groups of dialogues can be gated by a tab-indent statements.

```
@if(PersonA_is_pissed)
    PersonA: I am really pissed off
    PersonB: If you're pissed off so am I!
PersonA: I will say this line regardless of if I'm pissed off or not.
```


### Variables

Variables are defined or imported at the top of each .halc file. with the `@vars` directive.

```
@vars(
    import PersonA; # This imports the PersonA namespace 
    # This defines a variable in the PersonA namespace
    def PersonAIsPissed = false; 
    # This defines a variable in the PersonA namespace
    def PersonA.isPissed = false; 
    # generally I'd recommend having the character definition 
    # wherever it is also defining all of it's variables

    # if def for the same variable from a global namespace name
    # is called more than once
)
```

#### namespaces

```
@vars{
    namespace PersonA{ 
        # this defines a namespace and can be accessed via a dot specifier.
        
    };
}
```

#### characters

To define a character, you declare it in a `@vars` like this.

The `name` variable will be used for the speaker name.

```
@vars {
    character PersonA { 
        def name = "I have a really long name"; 
    };
}
```


## The Runtime

`Warning, nerd stuff ahead!`

#### language runtime in detail

```
@if(PersonA_is_pissed)
PersonA: I am pissed off
PersonA: I will say this line regardless of if I'm pissed off or not.
```
